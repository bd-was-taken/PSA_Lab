Experiments for PSA Lab

The folder names are the experiment
In order to run the MALTAB code, you need to install the full folder (e.g. to run Y Bus experiment, you need to install the Y bus folder for the excel files as they contain bus data and line data)

In Ybus folder, there is Y_bus.m program. It is the code for both Y bus and Gauss Seidel method (change the values if needed in the given bus_data.xlsx and line_data.xlsx)
